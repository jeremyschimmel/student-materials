Student Connect App Project Business Requirements

## Executive Summary

The purpose of this project is to create an application that will allow students to meet with like-minded students. It will allow students to log into an application and post ideas that they have or search for ideas that other students have created. Students will be able to connect with other students, share ideas, and find projects to work on together.

With this project you will find the necessary steps that will be needed in order to create this project. Please make sure the following requirements are met with your team before working on the design for the project.

## Business Objectives

This project is important because it will allow users to connect with other users in a way that has never been done before and share ideas. The application needs to be seamless and run on multiple platforms. It must also be safe with the proper security measures in place to make sure user information is not compromised. It is expected that users from all over the world with different devices or mobile operating systems will be able to communicate easily and efficiently.

## Background

This project is being initiated with the goal in mind that students don't have an easy application to use that will allow them to share ideas and work on projects together. Our team had the idea for this project when we discovered there wasn't an application available that allowed students to share their ideas and work on projects with each other.

## Scope

The application does not need to automatically translate languages into English, even though users may use other languages to communicate with other users.

## Functional requirements

-The application must be able to run on iOS and Android systems.
-Users must be able to sign up and create an account with an email and password.
-The user must be able to log in with a username and password, with the ability to save their password or retrieve it with a Forgot Password feature.
-The user must be able to create, post, edit, and delete ideas that other users can see.
-Users must be able to create projects and work on the same project with other users.
-Users can create a profile, follow other users, "like" ideas and projects, and private message other users.
-Users can make to-do lists for a project that other users on the project can see, edit, and add to.
-All posts, edits, and updates to ideas and projects must update seamlessly that other users can see immedately.
-Users should be motivated to engage with others by earning badges for milestones from sharing ideas and projects with other users. These badges can be posted on their profile for others to see on their profile. These badges will unlock unique personalization settings for their profile where their ideas and projects will also be posted.
-Users can create privacy settings for ideas and projects and choose who can see them.
-Users can post photos, files, and documents for other users to see for ideas and projects.
-There must be a settings menu where users can choose personal, privacy, and security settings.
-There must be a contact menu where users can contact our developers to report any issues they encounter.

## Personnel requirements

We need one team of 3-5 developers to work on user interface for the project. We will need another team of 2-3 developers to work on security for the application. The third team of 3-5 developers will work on creating and testing the functionailty of the application.

## Delivery schedule

Phase One will be 2-3 weeks for design of the application. Phase Two will be 4-6 weeks for software implementation. Phase Three will be 1-2 weeks for Verification of the software. Phase Four will be the final phase and will be 1-2 weeks for maintenance of the application.

## Other requirements

The application must be able to function properly on all screen resolutions and sizes and adjust accordingly. It must have disability access for users to change colors for colorblind users, change text size, have text-to-speech, audio descriptions, and bluetooth access for hearing aids.

## Assumptions

The application and system won't be reliant on using Google Maps API to know a user's location or Google Translate to translate different languages. All languages and keyboards must be accessible and implemented but not automatically translated through a third-party API. 

## Limitations

Our limitations include our budget for the application project and not working beyond the suggested timeframe. We must also keep the application within the iOS and Android systems and not implemented for any other mobile operating systems.

## Risks

The risks involved include: not implementing the correct security measures that can put users' information and important projects at risk and not having an application that is easy for the user to use. We must keep it easy to use and continue to implement new additions to the application to keep users interested in using it to share their ideas and projects. If users can't stay engaged or interested in the application and we can't meet their expectations, the application will not experience longevity. Our development teams must also collaborate with each other to make sure the timeframe is being met for each development cycle to ensure that the application is released on schedule.
